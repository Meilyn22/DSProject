# Introduction to sets in Python
In this lesson, we are going to learn about sets in the Python programing language.

A set is a collection of unordered elements that are unique. In Python, sets are extraordinary because they have no duplicate values or items, so we can utilize them to eliminate duplicate elements from lists and tuples effectively. In addition, the elements in a set are immutable, which means we cannot change them. Some other immutable data types in Python are strings, tuples, and numbers such as integers and floats

## Creating a set

The syntax of a set is similar to other data structures like lists and dictionaries with minor differences. To create a set, we begin by writing a pair of curly brackets `{}`; inside the brackets, we separate the elements of the set by commas and a space(optional) just like we would do in a list or by using the built-in set() function.

![Syntax of a set](pictures/sets.png)

*Creating a set looks similar to creating a dictionary; you enclose a bunch of items within braces.*

(*Source*: Freecodecamp.org)

A set can contain any number of elements regardless of type (integer, float, tuple, string etc). However, a set cannot have mutable elements like lists, sets or dictionaries as its elements (A frozen set can resolve this problem).

```python
# set of integers
>>> my_set = {1, 2, 3}
>>> print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
>>> my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
>>> print(my_set)

```

### Using the `set()` Constructor
Another way to create a set is using the `set()` function or constructor. For example, we could Create a set from a list, tuple or string using the `set()` constructor to implement this. The data structure will be converted to a set, removing duplicate elements.

![converting a list to a set](pictures/sets1.png)

(*Source*: Freecodecamp.org)

Examples of using a `set()` constructor.

```python
# defining a set
{1, 2, 3, 4}
# Converting a string to a set
print(set('abcd'))
# prints
{'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'} #Could be in different order

# Converting a list to a set
print(set([1, 2, 3, 4]))
# prints
{1, 2, 3, 4}

# Converting a tuple to a set
print(set((1, 2, 3, 4)))
# prints
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

--------------------------------------------------
:memo: If the element in the `set()` has duplicate values, they will be removed to create the set.
--------------------------------------------------

example:

```python
items = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 4]
print(set(items))
# prints
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### Modifying a set in Python
We said elements in a set are immutable earlier, but we need to understand that a set itself is mutable. However, since the elements are unordered, indexing cannot be done.  

The reason why we said the elements are immutable is because we cannot access or change them using slicing or indexing (common with a list). Sets include helpful built-in methods to help us perform common and essential functionality such as adding elements, deleting elements, and clearing the set.

--------------------------------------------------------
:memo: According to the Python Documentation:          
                                                      
The set type is mutable â€” the contents can be changed  
using methods like add() and remove(). Since it is     
mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used       
as either a dictionary key or as an element of another set.
---------------------------------------------------------                                                   

Before we go into these built-in methods we can quickly talk about Membership Testing.

### Membership Testing
We can check if an element exists in the set by using the `in` operator.

![in operator illustration of a set](pictures/sets.png)

This in an example:
``` python
a = "hhheeelllooo"
b = set(a)
print(b)
{'e', 'l', 'o', 'h'}

# Test if the characters 'e' and 'a' are in set b
'e' in b
True
'a' in b
False

#defining another set
a = {'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'melon', 'mango'}
print('banana' in a)
True
print('papaya' in a)
False

#defining another set
b = set(['melon', 'orange', 'mango', 'banana', 'papaya'])
print('banana' in b)
True
print('papaya' in b)
True
```
## Methods of set

### Set Size
We can obtain the size of a set (the number of elements) using the built in len() function. in poython.

``` python
a = {'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'melon', 'mango'}
print (a)
print ('size of a:', len(a))
# prints
{'melon', 'orange', 'mango', 'banana', 'apple'}
size of a: 5
```

### Add to a Set
To add items to a set, we utilize the built in `.add()` method. We pass the element we want to add as an argument.

``` python
e = {1, 2, 3, 4}
.add(5)
print(e)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

example 2:

``` python
a = [random.randint(0, 10) for x in range(10)]
print ('list =>', a)
m = set(a)
print ('set =>', m)
m.add(10)
print ('after add =>',  m)
# prints
list => [3, 4, 7, 2, 8, 0, 4, 1, 0, 4]
set => {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
after add => {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10}
```

We will need to use a loop to add multiple elements since the `add()` method accepts only a single argument.

We cannot add a list to a set since the list cannot be hashed.

``` python
m.add(5)
print ('after add =>', m)
m.add([21, 22])
print (m)
# prints
TypeErrorTraceback (most recent call last)
 in ()
      5 m.add(10)
      6 print ('after add =>', m)
----> 7 m.add([21, 22])
      8 print (m)

TypeError: unhashable type: 'list
```

However, we can add a tuple since it is not mutable and hence hashable.

``` python
m.add((19, 20))
print (m)
# prints
{0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, (19, 20), 9, 10]}
```

### Delete from a Set

We can make use of 3 ways to delete element from a set.
1. `.remove()`
2. `.discard()`
3. `.pop()`

-----------------------------------------------------
:memo: According to freecodecamp.org:
The first two methods (.remove() and .discard()) work exactly the same when the element is in the set. The new set is returned:

``` python
#Remove a single element from a set using remove().
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.remove(3)
print(a)
{1, 2, 4}

a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.discard(3)
print(a)
{1, 2, 4}
```

The key difference between these two methods is that if we use the `.remove()` method, we run the risk of trying to remove an element that doesn't exist in the set and this will raise a `KeyError`:

``` python
# A KeyError is raised if the element is not in the set. (Running the same code as above a couple of times generates a random sequence without 10 in the set.)

a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.remove(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#102>", line 188, in <module>
    a.remove(5)
KeyError: 5
```
We will never have that problem with `.discard()` since it doesn't raise an exception if the element is not found. This method will simply leave the set intact, as you can see in this example:

``` python
# Need to remove an element from a set without the pesky KeyError? Use discard().

a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.discard(5)
print(a)
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```
The third method `(.pop())` will remove and return an arbitrary element from the set and it will raise a KeyError if the set is empty.

``` python
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.pop()
1
a.pop()
2
a.pop()
3
print(a)
{4}
a.pop()
4
print(a)
set()
>>> a.pop()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#119>", line 1, in <module>
    a.pop()
KeyError: 'pop from an empty set'
```

---------------------------------------------------------

### Clear the Set
To delete all the elements in a set, the `.clear()` method is used.

``` python
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.clear()
a
set()
len(a)
0
```

## Copy
This method is used to make a copy of the Set.
``` python
sample = {1,2,3,4,5}
new_sample = sample.copy()
print(new_sample)
{1,2,3,4,5}
```
## Update Method
We can use this method to add multiple values to a set, we can also pass new sets or list or both, and it will be added to the set. This method allows us put a list in a set.

``` python
sample = {1,2,3,4,5}
sample.update([6,7,8])
print(sample)

{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
``` 

## Set Operations
We can utilize some mathematical set theory operations in python. `union(|)`, `intersection (&)`, `difference (-)`, and `symmetric difference (^)` are all available in the python programming language.

The image below shows a couple standard math operations on two sets A and B. The red part of each Venn diagram is the resulting set of a given set operation

![set math operations](pictures/set3.png)

(*source*: https://towardsdatascience.com)

### Union

Union creates a new set with the elements of all sets.In python we can use `|` to specify `union`.

This is an example:
``` python
a = {3, 1, 7, 4}
b = {2, 8, 3, 1}
c = a | b
print(c)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8} # Might be in different order.
```

We can also apply this on more than two sets.
``` python
a = {3, 1, 7, 4}
b = {2, 8, 3, 1}
c = {1, 0, 4, 6}
d = {8, 2, 6, 3}

# Union of these four sets
print (a | b | c | d)
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets creates another set that contains all the values that are in both A and B.
We can use the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator.

This is an example:
``` python
a = {3, 6, 1}
b = {2, 8, 3, 1}
print(a & b)
{1, 3}
```
It works on more than two sets as well:
``` python
a = {3, 1, 7, 4, 5}
b = {2, 8, 3, 1, 5}
c = {1, 0, 4, 6, 5}
d = {8, 2, 6, 3, 5}

# Only 5 is in a, b, c, and d.
print(a & b & c & d)
{5}
```
### Difference

Set difference returns a new set containing all elements in the argument set that are not in the other sets. In other words, this will create another set that contains all the elements of set A that are not in set B. We can use the `-` sign to represent the set difference.

This is an example:
``` python
a = {3, 6, 1}
b = {2, 8, 3, 1}
print (a - b)
{6}
```

It works on more than two sets as well:

``` python
a = {3, 1, 7, 4, 5}
b = {2, 8, 3, 1, 5}
c = {1, 0, 4, 6, 5}

# Only 7 is in A but not in B and not in C
print (a - b - c)
{7}

```
### Symmetric Difference

The symmetric difference between set 1 and set 2 creates another set with all elements that are either in set 1 or set 2, but aren't in both. Think about the intersection, we are simply getting rid of it. We can use `^` to represent `Symmetric Difference`.

:memo: we are removing the intersection and returning the remaining items.   
``` python
a = {3, 6, 1}
b = {2, 8, 3, 1}
print(a ^ b)
{2, 6, 8}
```

## Solving problems with sets

Question:

You have a double dimensional list of N length. Without using the built in intersection function, combine the list into one without duplicate. Order doesn't matter.

```
Input : items = [[1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 6],
              [5, 1, 3, 4, 1],
              [9, 5, 7, 1, 4],
              [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]]
Output : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
```

solution:
``` python

def join_All(items):
    #We can grab the first item in the list and turn it into a set.
    join = set(items[0])
    # Go through the list and grab all the items starting from the second.
    # Put all of them in one list and remove the duplicate.
    # change the set to a list and return it.  
    for values in items[1:]:
        join.update(values)
    return list(join))

print(join_All(items))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
```
## Exercise

Write a program in python that returns the intersection of two sets without using any python inbuilt function.
Write another function using python's builtin intersection function.

`INPUT`:

a = `{"Soccer", "Basktball", "Golf", "Cricket", "Baseball"}`

b = `{"Rugby", "American football(Hand egg), "Baseball", "Golf", "Soccer"}`

`OUTPUT`: {'Golf', 'Soccer', 'Baseball'}



<details>
<summary> Solution </summary>

``` python

a = {"Soccer", "Basktball", "Golf", "Cricket", "Baseball"}

b = {"Rugby", "American football(Hand egg)", "Baseball", "Golf", "Soccer"}

#EXAMPLE1
def intersectionA(a, b):
    #New set.
    #loop into "a" and check if values appear in b.
    #Put the values in new set

    for items in a:
        if items in b:
            values.add(items)
    return values
