A general divide-and-conquer algorithm

Step 1: If the problem size is small, solve this problem directly; otherwise, split the original problem into 2 sub-problems with equal sizes.
Step 2: Recursively solve these 2 sub-problems by applying this algorithm.
Step 3: Merge the solutions of the 2 sub-problems into a solution of the original problem.

```
DAC(a, i, j)
{
    if(small(a, i, j))
      return(Solution(a, i, j))
    else 
      m = divide(a, i, j)               // f1(n)
      b = DAC(a, i, mid)                 // T(n/2)
      c = DAC(a, mid+1, j)            // T(n/2)
      d = combine(b, c)                 // f2(n)
   return(d)

b What will be your algorithm’s output for arrays with several elements of
the largest value?

It returns the left largest element.

c Still trying to calculate on Markdown.
C(n) = C(n/2) + C(n/2)+1 for n > 1, C(1) = 0.

d How does this algorithm compare with the brute-force algorithm for this
problem?

Brute force is slow. May have to scan through the array more than usual.

a: Pseudocode is hard for me. I would rather write the code.
b C(n)=2C(n/2) + 2 for n > 2, C(2) = 1, C(1) = 0.

c How does this algorithm compare with the brute-force algorithm for this
problem?

It does less comparison comapared to bruteforce. However, it might not be faster than bruteforce because of the recursion overhead.

a Sort the array first and then scan it to find the smallest difference between two successive elementsA[i]andA[i+1](0≤i≤n−2)

b. Brute force O(n)2, algorithm O(n log n)

6.2 
a. Initialize a list to contain elements of C,
Compare every elementai in A with successive elements of B,
add this value to the list C and proceed to the next element in A.

b. first solution: Sort elements of one of the sets, say,A,stored in an array. Then use binary search to search for each element of B in the sorted arrayA: if a match is found,add this value to the list C.If sorting is done with a O(nlogn) algorithm, the total running time will be in O((m+n)logn)

6.3

a. Sort the list and return its first and last elements as the values of the smallest and largest elements, respectively. Assuming the efficiency of the sorting algorithm used is in O(nlogn),the time efficiency of the entire algorithm will be in O(nlogn).
