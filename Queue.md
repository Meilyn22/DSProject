# Introduction to Queues

Queues are fundamental to data structures in programming. A queue is a close “cousin” of the stack; it’s a collection of objects inserted and removed according to the FIFO (First-in, first-out) principle. Meaning that the entity put in the queue first leaves the line (queue) first, and the entity that enters the queue last gets removed at the end.

The idea is that elements enter a queue through the back and are taken away from the front. An analogy for this is a line of individuals queuing to get on a carnival ride. Individuals waiting for such a ride enter at the rear of the line and get on the ride from the front of the line. To remember this concept, you can also use the acronym “FCFS,” which means first-come, first-served.

Another great example would be a car wash where cars queue up to get a wash. The vehicles stay in a line waiting for their turn. The first car to show up gets to wash first, while the last car remains until all other vehicles that came before it is gone. Now we can wash the last vehicle and close for the day when we have no vehicles left.

Let’s have a look at one more example.

### The Movie Ticket Counter

Customers can only enter from the rear end and leave from the front in these ticket counters. All other paths are closed with the help of barricades. Furthermore, the person who enters the ticket line first will exit first and the last person will exit last.

Stores, theaters, reservation centers, and other similar services typically process customer requests according to the FIFO principle. In addition, many computing devices also use FIFO queues, such as a networked printer or a Web server responding to requests. Therefore, a queue would be a logical choice for a data structure to handle calls to a customer service center or a wait-list at a restaurant. 

## Operations and Structure Of Queues

Unlike arrays and linked list, items in a queue cannot be operated from their respective locations. They can only be operated from the rare or front position. Also the structure of a queue depends on the perspective of the programmer.

### enqueue(items)
The enqueue in python adds a new item to the queue. We can call this side the rare or the back.

### dequeue()

The dequeue() removes items from the front of the queue. We can call this side the front.

Let's see some picture illustration of how these two operations work in python.

We can write our own functions to add more functionality to the queue.

### Rear()
Returns the first item from the back or end of the queue.

### Front()

Returns the first item from the front of the queue.

### is_empty()

Returns the state of the queue. It tells us if the queue is empty or not.

## Queue Implementation
Queue in Python can be implemented in the following ways:

1. list
2. collections.deque
3. queue.Queue

### List
The lists is a data structure in python. We are going to implement a queue using  a class in python.

### Step 1:

We need a queue class.

``` python
class Queue:
    pass
```

### Step 2:

We need to have an empty list to store the data. Let us name this `items`.

``` python
class Queue:

	def __init__(self):
		self.items = []
```

### Step 3:

Now we can start creating methods for our program. These methods will implement the various behaviors we talked about earlier in this chapter. 

``` python
class Queue:

	def enqueue(self, data):
		self.items.append(data)
		return data
```

### Step 4:

Now we can add the dequeue method which removes the first item from the queue.
We can do this by using the pop() method in python.

``` Python
class Queue:

	def dequeue(self):
		return self.itemss.pop(0)
```
Our queue is pretty much done at this point, but we can add other methods to access the first and last items in the list.

### Step 5:

``` python
class Queue:
	def rear(self):
		return self.items[-1]
```

### step 6:

``` python
class Queue:
	def front(self):
		return self.items[0]
```

###Step 7:

We can check whether the queue is empty with the is_empty() method we will create.

``` python
class Queue:
	def is_empty(self):
		return len(self.itemss) == 0
```
``` python
class Queue:

if __name__ == '__main__':
	queue = Queue()

```
